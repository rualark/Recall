<p>Create associative pairs to secure your secrets.
Each associative pair starts with a ? symbol, where the question (or clue) is
on the right and the answer is on the left, separated by an =.

<p>If you want to create layers of protection, separate groups of associative
pairs with ---. This will ensure that the next group of questions is only
accessible after correctly solving the previous group.

<p>To ensure your password is robust, aim for at least 15 elements in one
of the groups. Make sure the answers are not too obvious, and that all
choices seem equally plausible for each question, making it harder for anyone to guess.

<p>Any line that doesn't start with a ? is your secret information
(like passwords) that Recall will encrypt for you.
