<h4>How it works:</h4>
The encryption key is derived based on the correct pairing. 
The whole text is encrypted.
The associative pairs are mixed within their groups and are not encrypted.
You are presented with packed text containig both encrypted and unencrypted
parts that you can safely put anywhere.
If you want to recall or change your secrets or pairs, take your encrypted
text and paste it into <a href=recaller.html>Recaller</a>.

<p>Lines starting with ? are associative pairs (separated with =).
You can separate groups of pairs with ---, this will allow to present groups
of pairs without mixing them.
To have a strong associative password, ensure that you have at least 13 elements
in at least one group and all of them seem to be equally fitting for each question.
All other lines is just your secret information that you want to protect.
